Periods
=======

One of the goals of DjangoSchedule is to make occurrence generation and persistence easy.  To do this it creates simple classes for accessing these
occurrences.  These are Periods.  Period is an object that is initiated with an iterable object of events, a start datetime, and an end datetime.

It is common to subclass Period for common periods of time.  Some of these already exist in the project.  Year, Month, Week, Day

Expect more in the future: Hour, HalfHour

Period Base Class
-----------------

This is the base class from which all other periods inherit.  It contains all
of the base functionality for retrieving occurrences.  It is instantiated with
a list of events, a start date, and an end date. *The start date is inclusive,
the end date is exclusive.* ie [start, end)

>>> p = Period(datetime.datetime(2008,4,1,0,0))

``get_occurrences()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This method is for getting the occurrences from the list of passed in events. It returns the occurrences that exist in the period for every event.  If I have a list of events ``my_events``, and I want to know all of the occurrences from today to next week I simply create a Period object and then call get_occurrences. It will return a sorted list of Occurrences.

::

    import datetime

    today = datetime.datetime.now()
    this_week = Period(my_events, today, today+datetime.timedelta(days=7))
    this_week.get_occurrences()

``classify_occurrence(occurrence)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You use this method to determine how the Occurrence ``occurrence`` relates to the period. This method returns a dictionary with the following keys: ``"occurrence"``, ``"class"``, ``"css_class"``, ``"spans"``, ``"only_starts"``, ``"only_ends"``, ``"starts_ends"``.

 * ``"occurrence"`` returns the occurrence.
 * ``"class"`` returns one of the ``OCCURRENCE_{SPANS|STARTS|ENDS|STARTS_ENDS}`` constants.
 * ``"css_class"`` returns a css class string.
 * one of ``"spans"``, ``"only_starts"``, ``"only_ends"`` and ``"starts_ends"`` is set to True and the others False based on the occurrence's classification.

``get_occurrence_partials()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This method is used for getting all the occurrences, but getting them as classified occurrences.  Simply it runs classify_occurrence on each occurrence in get_occurrence and returns that list.

::

    import datetime

    today = datetime.datetime.now()
    this_week = Period(my_events, today, today+datetime.timedelta(days=7))
    this_week.get_occurrences() == [classified_occurrence['occurrence'] for classified_occurrence in this_week.get_occurrence_partials()]

``has_occurrence()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This method returns whether there are any occurrences in this period

Year
----

The year period is instaniated with a list of events and a date or datetime object. It will resemble the year in which that date exists.

>>> p = Year(events, datetime.datetime(2008,4,1))
>>> p.start
datetime.datetime(2008, 1, 1, 0, 0)
>>> p.end
datetime.datetime(2009, 1, 1, 0, 0)
>>> -Remember start is inclusive and end is exclusive

``get_months()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function returns 12 Month objects which resemble the 12 months in the Year period.

Month
-----

The Month period is instantiated with a list of events and a date or  datetime object.  It resembles the month that contains the date or datetime object that was passed in.

>>> p = Month(events, datetime.datetime(2008,4,4))
>>> p.start
datetime.datetime(2008, 4, 1, 0, 0)
>>> p.end
datetime.datetime(2008, 5, 1, 0, 0)
>>> -Remember start is inclusive and end is exclusive

``get_weeks()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This method returns a list of Week objects that occur at all during that month.  The week does not have to be fully encapsulated in the month just have
exist in the month at all

``get_days()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This method returns a list of Day objects that occur during the month.

``get_day(day_number)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This method returns a specific day in a year given its day number.

Week
----

The Week period is instantiated with a list of events and a date or  datetime object.  It resembles the week that contains the date or datetime object that was passed in.

>>> p = Week(events, datetime.datetime(2008,4,1))
>>> p.start
datetime.datetime(2008, 3, 30, 0, 0)
>>> p.end
datetime.datetime(2008, 4, 6, 0, 0)
>>> -Remember start is inclusive and end is exclusive

``get_days()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This method returns the 7 Day objects that represent the days in a Week period.

Day
---

The Day period is instantiated with a list of events and a date or  datetime object.  It resembles the day that contains the date or datetime object that was passed in.

>>> p = Day(events, datetime.datetime(2008,4,1))
>>> p.start
datetime.datetime(2008, 4, 1, 0, 0)
>>> p.end
datetime.datetime(2008, 4, 2, 0, 0)
>>> -Remember start is inclusive and end is exclusive
